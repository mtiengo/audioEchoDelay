# Audio Echo Application

## Overview

The Audio Echo Application is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool that allows users to add an echo effect to audio files. Built using Python, it uses libraries like NumPy, SoundFile, Tkinter, and Pygame to manipulate and play audio files efficiently.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Support:** Users can easily drag and drop audio files into the application for processing.
- **Echo Effect Parameters:** Users can customize the echo effect by adjusting:
  - **Delay (ms):** The delay time before the echo effect is applied.
  - **Decay (0.0 - 1.0):** Controls the reduction in volume of the echoed sound.
- **Playback Control:** Users can play and stop the audio with the added echo effect.
- **Save Modified Audio:** The modified audio can be saved to a new file.
